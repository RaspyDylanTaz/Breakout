# Breakout

#This is a simple version of the famous arcade game breakout. The project was written in java and was being used as a project to get myself back into coding.

#The code is 99% of the way to what I want it to be, the game compiles and runs. 

#The game was made along with a menu and hiscores to give the game a more wholesome and complete feel about it.

#Below is a few shots of the final product.
